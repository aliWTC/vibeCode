I built a web two-player (on one keyboard) game. 
To make this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I used ChatGPT to help me make this project. I mainly used
it for the tedious things so that I wouldn't have to do the
dirty work, and I used it very heavily for debugging. 

I am proud of the UI, I like the simplicity and effectiveness 
of the game, it does what it's supposed to. 

If I had more time, I'd improve the site by including more games and
fixing some bugs.
